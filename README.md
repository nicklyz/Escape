Implemented doors and keys.
Make sure to use MyHUD instead of the default one before launching.
Currently you need a gold key to open the wooden door, and a red key to open the red door. All textures/maps are temporary, just for testing.
Once the door is opened, you press E to close them.
Press E to pick up keys.
